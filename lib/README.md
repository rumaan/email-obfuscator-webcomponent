2. In your html/Component template add the webcomponent with the encoded image source.

```html
<email-address src="./encoded-image.png"></email-address>
```

For some frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/web-components.html#example-vite-config) for example, you might need to configure the bundler so it plays well with web components.

Framework Usages:

- [Vue](/demo/vue/) 
- [React](/demo/react/) 

## Customizable Slots

You can use `slot="loading"` to customize the loading state of the component.

```html
<email-address src="./encoded-image.png">
  <span slot="loading">...</span>
</email-address>
```

You can customize the anchor link using `::part()` pseudo-element selector to match the `link` part.

```css
email-address::part(link) {
  display: inline-block;
  color: green;
}
```

Or if you want to use a custom tag instead of the default anchor text you can use the `slot="link"` like so:

```html
<email-address src="https://rumaan.dev/jkvu1o0le24.png">
  <span slot="loading">...</span>
  <span slot="link"> This is a customised mailto link </span>
</email-address>
```

## TODOS

- [x] Expose [slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots) to customise link
- [x] Export webcomponent types
- [x] Tests
- [x] Readme with examples using in React, Vue etc.
